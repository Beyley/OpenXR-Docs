*Overview*

This extension provides APIs for force feedback capable of restricting 
movement along a linear actuation such as a trigger or finger curl. 
The intended use for this extension is to provide practical force 
feedback functionality for force-feedback controllers and VR gloves.
The term "linear actuator" in this extension is used as a catch-all for devices such as 
controller triggers, or of a finger curling.

No valid force feedback haptic sources are defined in this extension.

The slink:XrHapticForceFeedbackConstantMNDX structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHapticForceFeedbackConstantMNDX.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:numZones indicates the amount of haptic zones the application is passing in, 
  with a maximum length of ename:XR_MAX_HAPTIC_FORCE_FEEDBACK_ZONES_MNDX.
* pname:zoneForces is a pointer to the forces to apply when the linear actuator is inside of each zone. 
  Each force value has it's normal range defined as `0.0` through `1.0`. 
  Runtimes must: accept values above `1.0`, but may: clamp the value to `1.0` if the hardware does not support a force stronger than 6lbf.
  The force that should be required to move through the zone can be calculated as such: 
  `(pname:zoneForces[n] / pname:numZones) * 6lbf`. If hardware supports a force stronger than 6lbf, 
  then the runtime should: have `1.0` be derived from 6lbf, 
  and numbers higher than `1.0` should: be defined based on a linear multiple of 6lbf. 
  For example, zone force of `2.0`, the equation should be filled in as such: `(2.0 / pname:numZones) * 6lbf`.
  If a device does not support applying 6lbf of feedback, the runtime should: replace 6lbf in the equations 
  with the maximum feedback force it is capable of applying. For example, a device which is only able to 
  provide 4lbf of force should fill in the equation as such: `(pname:zoneForces[n] / pname:numZones) * 4lbf`.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:start is the position of the linear actuator at which force feedback should start.
* pname:end is the position of the linear actuator at which force feedback should end, 
  allowing the user to move the trigger unrestricted from pname:end to the farthest position of the linear actuator.
* pname:strength is a value from `0.0` to `1.0` specifying how strong the feedback should be. 
  The amount of force required to move the linear actuator from pname:start to pname:end is defined as `pname:strength * 6lbf`. 
  If the hardware is unable to apply 6lbf, `1.0` should be the maximum force the hardware is capable of applying. 
  Runtimes must: accept values greater than `1.0`, but may: clamp the force to the strongest force it is capable of applying.
* pname:kickBack is a value from `0.0` to `1.0` specifying how strong the kickback upon release should be.
  This kick back may: apply at any point within the linear actuator's return motion. This is defined as the same algorithm as pname:strength.

****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:currentZone is the zone that is currently active for the action. 
  This number's meaning depends on the last active force feedback type. 
  For slink:XrHapticForceFeedbackConstantMNDX, this number is the zone that is currently active, 
  this zone is in the range defined by the application when it applied the haptic vibration. 
  For slink:XrHapticForceFeedbackWeaponMNDX, the returned zone is `0` for before the weapon force feedback 
  is triggered (eg. within the device-interpolated zones between `0.0` and `pname:start`), 
  `1` for during the force feedback's resistance (eg. within the device-interpolated zones 
  between `pname:start` and `pname:end`), and `2` for after the force feedback's resistance 
  (eg. within the device-interpolated zones between `pname:end` and `1.0`). Due to the unknown 
  nature of when the pname:kickBack force may be applied (and due to it may be being applied instantaneously), 
  the kick-back force is not considered a discrete zone.
  For slink:XrHapticForceFeedbackVibrationMNDX, this number is the zone that is currently active, 
  this zone is in the range defined by the application when it applied the haptic vibration. 
  If no force feedback vibration effect is currently active, this must: return -1.
* pname:changedSinceLastSync is ename:XR_TRUE if the value of
  pname:currentState is different than it was before the most recent call to
  flink:xrSyncActions.
* pname:lastChangeTime is the basetype:XrTime associated with the most
  recent change to this action's state.
* pname:isActive is ename:XR_TRUE if and only if there exists an input
  source that is contributing to the current state of this action.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession to query.
* pname:getInfo is a pointer to slink:XrActionStateGetInfo to provide action and subaction paths information.
* pname:state is a pointer to a valid slink:XrActionStateBoolean into which the state will be placed.
****

When this extension is enabled, and a valid force feedback haptic source is bound, 
but the underlying device does not support haptic feedback, the runtime must: 
emulate the result of flink:xrGetActionStateForceFeedbackZoneMNDX, 
even if no force feedback hardware is in use. This allows applications to rely 
on the resulting zone to trigger actions such as a weapon firing.
