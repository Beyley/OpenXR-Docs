*Overview*

This extension provides APIs for force feedback capable of restricting 
movement along a linear actuation such as a trigger or finger curl.

The intended use for this extension is to provide practical force 
feedback functionality for force-feedback controllers and VR gloves.

The term "linear actuator" in this extension is used as a catch-all for devices such as 
controller triggers, or of a finger curling.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:numZones indicates the amount of haptic zones the application is passing in, 
  with a maximum length of ename:XR_MAX_HAPTIC_FORCE_FEEDBACK_ZONES_MNDX.
* pname:zoneForces is a pointer to the forces to apply when the linear actuator is inside of each zone. 
  Each force value has it's normal range defined as `0.0` through `1.0`. 
  Runtimes must: accept values above `1.0`, but may: clamp the value to `1.0` if the hardware does not support a force stronger than 6lbf.
  The force that should be required to move through the zone can be calculated as such: 
  `(pname:zoneForces[n] / pname:numZones) * 6lbf`. If hardware supports a force stronger than 6lbf, 
  then the runtime should: have `1.0` be derived from 6lbf, 
  and numbers higher than `1.0` should: be defined based on a linear multiple of 6lbf. 
  For example, zone force of `2.0`, the equation should be filled in as such: `(2.0 / pname:numZones) * 6lbf`.
  If a device does not support applying 6lbf of feedback, the runtime should: replace 6lbf in the equations 
  with the maximum feedback force it is capable of applying. For example, a device which is only able to 
  provide 4lbf of force should fill in the equation as such: `(pname:zoneForces[n] / pname:numZones) * 4lbf`.

****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:start is the position of the linear actuator at which force feedback should start.
* pname:end is the position of the linear actuator at which force feedback should end, 
  allowing the user to move the trigger unrestricted from pname:end to the farthest position of the linear actuator.
* pname:strength is a value from `0.0` to `1.0` specifying how strong the feedback should be. 
  The amount of force required to move the linear actuator from pname:start to pname:end is defined as `pname:strength * 6lbf`. 
  If the hardware is unable to apply 6lbf, `1.0` should be the maximum force the hardware is capable of applying. 
  Runtimes must: accept values greater than `1.0`, but may: clamp the force to the strongest force it is capable of applying.
* pname:kickBack is a value from `0.0` to `1.0` specifying how strong the kickback upon release should be.
  This kick back may: apply at any point within the linear actuator's return motion. This is defined as the same algorithm as pname:strength.
